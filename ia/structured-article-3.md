**Tyrannosaurus** (/tɨˌrænəˈsɔrəs/ or /taɪˌrænəˈsɔrəs/; meaning "tyrant lizard", from Greek *tyrannos* (τύραννος) meaning "tyrant," and *sauros* (σαῦρος) meaning "lizard"[1]) is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur. The species  **Tyrannosaurus rex**  (rex meaning "king" in Latin), commonly abbreviated to **T. rex**, is a fixture in popular culture. It lived throughout what is now western North America, at the time an island continent termed Laramidia, with a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the upper Cretaceous Period, 67 to 65.5 million years ago.[2] It was among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.

Like other tyrannosaurids, *Tyrannosaurus**was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, *Tyrannosaurus* forelimbs were small, though unusually powerful for their size, and bore two clawed digits. Although other theropods rivaled or exceeded *Tyrannosaurus rex* in size, it was the largest known tyrannosaurid and one of the largest known land predators, the most complete specimen measuring up to 12.3 m (40 ft) in length,[3] up to 4 metres (13 ft) tall at the hips,[4] and up to 6.8 metric tons (7.5 short tons) in weight.[5] By far the largest carnivore in its environment, *Tyrannosaurus rex* may have been an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, and possibly sauropods,[6] although some experts have suggested it was primarily a scavenger. The debate over Tyrannosaurus as apex predator or scavenger is among the longest running in paleontology.
